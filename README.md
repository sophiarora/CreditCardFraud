# CreditCardFraud
preditive modeling on Credit Card Fraud Dataset from [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
In this reporsitory I plan to utilize the credit card fraud dataset to explore tree algorithms including random forest, GBM, xgboost and lightGBM
I will also explore the use of DNN using keras.
